**Company Formation Services** 

**Myanmar**

Myanmar, officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, is a country in Southeast Asia. Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest. With a size of 676,578 square kilometers (261,228 square miles), Myanmar is the largest of the Mainland Southeast Asian states by area. Its capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon. Myanmar has been a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) since 1997.

**The opportunities in Myanmar**

Myanmar, branded by the International Monetary Fund as Asia’s ‘final frontier’ has a population of 60 million and a growing GDP per capita at 7 to 8% annually. The consumer market is relatively young and offers great potential for suppliers of basic goods and services. The country’s attractive geographical location connects it with China, India, Bangladesh and the ASEAN members of Thailand and Laos, providing access to a market of approximately three billion people.

**Myanmar Government Support**

The Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar is inviting investors to the country to utilize the present business opportunities and is also trying to create a more investor-friendly business environment which would ultimately increase the growth of the economy of Myanmar.

**Single Shareholder and Single Director**

The New Myanmar Companies law allows companies with a single shareholder and single director to be established. It requires all companies established in Myanmar to appoint at least one director who is 'ordinarily resident' in Myanmar. A person will be considered to be ordinarily resident if they hold a permanent residency or is resident in Myanmar for at least 183 days in each 12 month period.  The period of residency will be calculated from the date of incorporation of a company (or the date of commencement of the new law for existing companies).

**Foreign Ownership**

In the case of a limited liability company, foreign ownership is allowed up to a maximum of 35% in local companies. This is a significant liberalization measure as foreign investors can now own up to 35% of the equity in Myanmar owned companies (directly or indirectly), without changing the company’s status to a 'foreign company'.
